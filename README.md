# Hacktoberfest 2021 event for Turku.py

## Workshop Agenda

- Let's divide to 3 groups that each will select one track
- For all tracks, the idea is quite the same:
  1. create action skeleton to main repo
  1. use and test action in test repo
  1. add actual functionality to main repo
  1. use and test the updated action in test repo
  1. do additional tasks if you have the time, energy and interest 😊
- For steps 1-4, the plan is to do those in teams so that each team member would have a chance to do one PR with support of others. Note that team should decide who implements which step (and you should _work together_, the steps should be done in order).
- You should have basic understanding of git and GitHub:

  - Forking a repository
  - Creating a feature branch
  - Adding files and commiting code
  - Creating a pull request

  If you are not familiar with all of this stuff, no worries, ask help from your team or the tutors.

- Step 5 issues are such that you can continue working on e.g. after the workshop if you get interested of the topic and wish to do more Hacktoberfest PRs 💻
- If we get the actions ready for use during October, they will be taken in use in [Findy Agency repositories](https://github.com/findy-network) 🔥
